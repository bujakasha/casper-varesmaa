# Casper Väresmaa


This is my personal website that i created for reqruitters and new clients. 

[Live site](https://caspervaresmaa.fi/) 

My site is build with gatsby.js static site generator, that is new way of making fast and secure static websites. I use bootstrap because it has great grid system. I also use purgecss on build so that all unused bootstrap css gets whipped away.
